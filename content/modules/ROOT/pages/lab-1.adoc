= Exploring the ansible-navigator interface


In this challenge, we'll explore the https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator[ansible-navigator, window=_blank] interface and highlight new features.

. First, run *ansible-navigator* with no additional options:
+
[source,shell]
----
ansible-navigator
----

+
NOTE: Now that you are in the *ansible-navigator* TUI, there are many sub-commands available to help in developing, testing and inspecting your local environment. By default, the *:welcome* subcommand has already been issued which shows a quick overview of available subcommands. Run *:help* to see more info.

. Try out the subcommand for displaying documentation of the ping module by issuing the following command in *ansible-navigator*:
+
[source,vim]
----
:doc ping
----

. You can exit the ansible-navigtor TUI by issuing the following command.
+
[source,vim]
----
:quit
----

. Run your simple playbook again to ping localhost, but this time leave off the *-m stdout* option:
+
[source,shell]
----
ansible-navigator run ./test.yml
----


. You can also run playbooks from within the ansible-navigator TUI by simply issuing the run command with path to playbook:
+
[source,shell]
----
:run ./test.yml
----

+
NOTE: In general, navigating *ansible-navigator* is done by using the number keys to select an option and the kbd:[Esc] key to go to the previous screen.

. Explore the play that was run by pressing the number corresponding to that line. You should be taken to the next screen that will contain a list of the tasks that ran as a part of that play. Inspect the tasks by pressing the number of the corresponding line.


* *Wondering how to select a line with a number greater than 9?* Simply prepend the number with a colon.
+
.Example: To select line 15, you would issue the command
[source,shell]
----
:15
----


* Select the gather_facts task by pressing kbd:[0] and issue the subcommand:
+
[source,shell]
----
:doc
----
+
NOTE: Using *ansible-navigator* is very helpful for quickly referencing documentation for specific tasks while debugging playbooks.

. Finally, you can pass subcommands directly to *ansible-navigator* on the command line. Try getting docs on with *setup* module:
+
[source,shell]
----
ansible-navigator doc setup
----

+
NOTE:  Remember, if you ever get stuck in *ansible-navigator*, kbd:[Esc] will always bring you to the previous screen. Pressing kbd:[Esc] when there are no more screens left will exit *ansible-navigator*.
