= Section 2: Fundamentals, test automation, information related tasks
In this section, you will focus on different approaches to configuring your network devices.
At the end of this section, you will have learned about the three main approaches to applying configuration changes to devices, using Ansible.


== 2.1 Building a new containerlab environment
Before we get started with configuring our switches, we need to build a new containerlab environment. This time, it will include some more switches in a traditional leaf-spine setup. As such:

image::lab2-overview.png[lab2 setup, 95%]

This means you will need to create a new containerlab topology file, which creates a setup with the spine switches in place as well.


=== Tasks
. ‚òëÔ∏è Task: Before you create the new setup, let's destroy the previous environment. You do that by runing below commands:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd $LABDIR/containerlab
sudo containerlab --runtime podman destroy -t lab1.yml
----

+
.Expected output is:
[source,text]
----
INFO[0000] Parsing & checking topology file: lab1.yml   
INFO[0000] Destroying lab: lab1                         
INFO[0010] Removing containerlab host entries from /etc/hosts file 
INFO[0010] Removing ssh config for containerlab nodes 
----

. ‚òëÔ∏è Task: Create a new containerlab topology file, which reflects above setup. Also, more specifically:

* Save your work in a the containerlab dictory and name the file lab2.yml
* kinds: should be ceos and image needs to be set to: localhost/ceos:4.32.0F
* Call your nodes: leaf1, leaf2, spine1, spine2
* startup-config should be ~/advanced-networking-workshop/containerlab/configs/leaf1-start.cfg for leaf1 and leaf2-start.cfg for leaf2.
* startup-config should be ~/advanced-networking-workshop/containerlab/configs/spine1-start.cfg for spine1 and spine2-start.cfg for spine2.
* Your four switches should be connected to each other as follows:
* The leaf switches should be connected to each other via ports eth9 on and eth10 (leaf1:eth9 to leaf2:eth9 and leaf1:eth10 to leaf2:eth10).
* The leaf switches should be connected to the spine switches as such: leaf1:eth11 to spine1:eth1, leaf1:eth12 to spine2:eth1. AND leaf2:eth11 to spine1:eth2 and leaf2:eth12 to spine2:eth2.

TIP: Well done, now we are ready to do some configuration of our switches.


== 2.2 Reviewing the initial desired configuration state

First off, as we learn the different main approaches to doing configuration management, we will keep the desired configuration state simple.
Don't worry, once you have learned these basics, you will get to work with more production like environments.

image::lab2-config.png[lab2 config state,95%]

Above we can see what switch configuration we will start working with. It represents a commonality in most networks, which is that some configuration is static across devices and some varies across devices. In our example, the VLAN configuration is the same across our two leaf switches, while the Ethernet interface configuration is differs more between the two. As we review different approaches to applying configuration, you will find that some methods works better for different types of configuration (static vs unique).

In general you have three different main approaches you can select from when applying configuration to network devices:

. Using the command module to send litteral cli commands (not recommended if it can be avoided).

. Using Ansible specific modules to manage specific tasks such as VLAN configuration, interface configuration, etc.

. Using a config module, to push specific static lines of configuration or dynamic lines of configuration using Ansible templating. 

.To inform your choices, there are three main questions you can ask yourself:

. What use-cases do I want to support? Examples:

* Reduced time to deliver - You want to be able to provide automatic network configuration associated with putting in place new servers and services. Focus will be all configuration required to establish a new environment for servers and services to live in. You probably will need to integrate with other solutions, such as IPAM solutions, etc.

* Increased delivery precision - You want configuration changes to be right from the start. To increase impact, you focus on the things which changes most or what things you most often get wrong.

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - as a part of a larger initiative, you deliver network configuration in an automatic fashion, scope for what you start focusing on gets dictated by the scope of your IaC project.

* Security - You deliver automation which supports security use-cases such as threat hunting (gathering information) and security incident management (isolating breaches, etc).

. What configuration will you manage? (Considering the use-case(s)). What configuration will you need to manage with your automation and on what devices? It's here that you start diving into the nature of the related configuration, if it's static or dynamic across devices, networks, etc.

. At what scale will you manage different types of configuration? If there is dynamic configuration across many devices to be dealt with, you will benefit more from approaches where you automatically generate configuration using templates - as creating unique static like definitions for each devices may scale badly.

Don't worry though, we will try out all the different methods, so you can decide yourself what works and what doesn't.

== 2.3 Using the command module to accomplish our desired state
We will start off doing a classic, which is learning what to NOT do: using the command module directly to make modification. The main reason why we cover it, is so that you may see it's limitations on full display. 

NOTE: Feel free to use the solutions, you are not meant to spend any significant time figure this part out.

=== Tasks:

. ‚òëÔ∏è Task: Create a playbook called cmd_config.yml which uses the arista.eos.eos_command module to accomplish below configuration for our leaf1 and leaf2 switches.

+
.Hints:
.. Use host_vars/clab-lab2-leaf1|clab-lab2-leaf2 variable files for switch unique configuration.
.. You have to state "config" on a separate line before start feeding cli command input, just as you would do if you do this manually, like this:

+
[source,shell]
----

- name: Apply VLAN 39 configuration
  arista.eos.eos_command:
    commands:
      - config
      - vlan 39
      - name prod

In the example above, we have done some work to separate static and dynamic configuration and should have come to the conclusion that in our case, it's mainly the "ip address" line which differs between the two leaf switches. Still, this is far from perfect. First off, the command module is not meant to be used like this, even if it is not uncommon to see that being the case. This becomes overly clear when the module for example does not return CHANGED when we perform changes to our switches.

* Moreover, questions to ask yourself is:

** What happens if the cli syntax changes?
** How do you see when configuration is actually changed on a device?
** Is this easy to maintain?

* The answers to above questions are:
** Your automation breaks and you may not know when that happens. Maintaining such automation over time will be costly, timewise.
** That is very complicated, as you would have to diff a previous backup to current running config to see that at all. The non-idempotent ways of the command modules flatly makes it unsuitable for applying configuration.
** No, it is not.

== 2.4 Learning about Network Resource modules
In your Ansible toolbox, there are a lot of modules built to manage specific configuration for your device, such as interface and VLAN configuration.
This part is about learning how to use those type of modules to accomplish our designed configuration state. and their common so called module states.

First let's learn a bit about these types of modules. Have a look at the different purpose specific modules available for some common vendors.
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/arista/eos/[Arista EOS modules]
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/ios/[Cisco IOS modules]
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/junipernetworks/junos/index.html[Juniper JunOS modules]

All these vendors have specific network resource modules to manage things such as:
* ACLs
* BGP
* L2, L3, LACP and LAG interfaces
* OSPF v2 and v3
* Route maps / routing instances
* VLANs
* VRFs

These purpose build modules allows you to enforce different configuration states for them, which allows you to change configuration in different ways.
Let's review those different states before we start using these modules.

=== 2.4.1: module state: "merged" (often the default)
Above option will merge the attributes we define with the existing device configuration, this means existing configuration which is not defined, will be left as is.
This option is default and will be the one selected if you do not define one.

* Let's look at how this works. Below we'll list how the switch configuration looks before we have run the Ansible automation, and how it looks afterwards.
+
.Before we run our Ansible automation the device looks like this:
[source,ini]
----
veos(config-vlan-20)#show running-config | section vlan
vlan 10
   name ten
!
vlan 20
   name twenty
----


* Next we have some Ansible automation which defines that the state of VLAN 20, should be set to suspend. Here, we also define the Ansible module state of merged.
+
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Merge given VLAN attributes with device configuration
  arista.eos.eos_vlans:
    config:
      - vlan_id: 20
        state: suspend
    state: merged
----


* After we have run this Ansible automation, the state of the devices will then be as follows:
+
[source,ini]
----
veos(config-vlan-20)#show running-config | section vlan
vlan 10
   name ten
!
vlan 20
   name twenty
   state suspend
----

+
NOTE: Here, we can see that the name "twenty" of vlan 20, has been kept as is, as we did not define that.

=== 2.4.2: module state: "replaced"
* Next, we can choose replaced. Replaced will force overwrite existing configuration for what we define, but leave other related configuration untouched.

+
.Before we run our Ansible automation the device looks like this:
[source,ini]
----
veos(config-vlan-20)#show running-config | section vlan
vlan 10
   name ten
!
vlan 20
   name twenty
----

* Now, if we run below Ansible automation, which configures VLAN 20, but nothing else, and which applies the eos_vlan state of replaced, as follows:
+
[source,ini]
----
- name: Merge given VLAN attributes with device configuration
  arista.eos.eos_vlans:
    config:
      - vlan_id: 20
        state: suspend
    state: replaced
----


* After we have run this Ansible automation, the state of the devices will then be as follows:
+
[source,ini]
----

veos(config-vlan-20)#show running-config | section vlan
vlan 10
   name ten
!
vlan 20
   state suspend
----

NOTE: Please note how "name twenty" now is gone, as we did not define that for VLAN 20, in our Ansible automation.At the same time, VLAN 10 is untouched, as we did not define anything for that.

=== 2.4.3: module state: "overridden"
* This options overrides the related device configuration, with whatever configuration you define. It means that if you have not defined something in your Ansible automation, it will be deleted from the device.

+
.Before we do anything, the device looks like this:
[source,ini]
----
veos(config-vlan-20)#show running-config | section vlan
vlan 10
   name ten
!
vlan 20
   name twenty
----


* Then, we'll run below Ansible automation, which configures a single VLAN on our device:
+
[source,ini]
----
- name: Override device configuration of all VLANs with provided configuration
  arista.eos.eos_vlans:
    config:
      - vlan_id: 20
        state: suspend
    state: overridden
----


* After above Ansible automation has run, the device will then look like this:
+
[source,ini]
----
veos(config-vlan-20)#show running-config | section vlan
vlan 20
   state suspend
----

+
Above we can see that that both VLAN 10 and the name definition for VLAN 20 is gone. This is because they were not defined.
Using "overridden" is clearly very powerful, as we will only end up with that is defined, but it's also easier to make misstakes, if we are for example generating this Ansible automation somehow and that automation suffers a failure, failing to define all VLANs we need.

=== 2.4.4: module state: "deleted"
* This option is self explainatory, it will remove a defined item (such as an interface, VLAN, etc). As an example:

+
[source,ini]
----
- name: Delete attributes of the given VLANs.
  arista.eos.eos_vlans:
    config:
      - vlan_id: 20
    state: deleted
----
+
Above configuration will delete VLAN 20 out of the device (but leave any other VLANs untouched).

=== 2.4.5: module state: "gathered"
* This option is to gather related configuration from a device, allowing you to process the information is a programtic fashion.
This is an alternativt to plainly using facts to gather the information about configuration, or running and parsing a "show" command.
+
.As an example, if with below Ansible automation:
[source,ini]
----
- name: Gather vlans facts from the device
  arista.eos.eos_vlans:
    state: gathered
----

+
.You get below data gathered:
[source,ini]
----
- vlan_id: 10
  name: ten
- vlan_id: 20
  state: suspend
----


=== 2.4.6: module state: "rendered" and "parsed"
The rendered option allows you to convert structured data, that you would fetch from facts gathering, to native device config. The "parsed" option allows you to do vice-versa. Meaning, to convert native device config, to structured data. Doing this is useful when you are using Ansible to document your network.

* So, "rendered" converts:
+
[source,ini]
----
- vlan_id: 10
  name: ten
- vlan_id: 20
  state: suspend
----


* To:
+
[source,ini]
----
vlan 10
   name ten
!
vlan 20
   name twenty
   state suspend
----

+
And "parsed" works in the opposite way.

              - address: "{{ eth12_ip_address }}"

Now, let's assess what we got, compared to our solution which used the command module. Key differences were:
* Less Ansible code
* Easier to understand code. Example: "mode: layer3" instead of "no switchport"
* We can see when changes are made
* Idempotency (changes are only made when required)
* We do not have to maintain cli command syntax, the modules does that for us.

== 2.7 Using config modules to make changes
The last approach is a simple, though very flexible and powerful way to manage configuration of network devices, which easily scales across tens of thousands of network devices, or more.

It is using the config module for our specific vendor to apply configuration. Advantage of using the config module is that we can inject arbitrary lines of configuration into a device, or inject a complete config file, which may be static in nature (one per device) or which may be generated dynamically using Ansible templating language (jinja2).

IMPORTANT: For some vendors, there was previously a separate template module, which is replaced by template support in the config module, in more recent time.

Have an initial look at the "config" module for some common network vendors:

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/arista/eos/eos_config_module.html#ansible-collections-arista-eos-eos-config-module[Arista EOS config module]

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/ios/ios_config_module.html#ansible-collections-cisco-ios-ios-config-module[Cisco IOS config module]

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/junipernetworks/junos/junos_config_module.html#ansible-collections-junipernetworks-junos-junos-config-module[Juniper JunOS config module]

You will quickly see that this module is indeed very powerful. Except for being able to change the configuration state of a device, it can also automatically create a backup of what the running config looked like, before we changed it. Other powerful features includes (depends on vendor):

* Command to run before or after changes are made

* Ability to define match statements for injected lines of config.

* And more...

Overall, there are three different ways to config configuration using the config module:

* By loading a static config file into a device

* By loading a dynamic config file, rendered as an Ansible template, and then loaded into a device.

* By injecting lines of config into a device

Now, it's time to try out some different ways to use the "config" module.

=== 2.7.1 Using the config module to load static config files into devices

The first thing we'll do is to load device specific static config files into the devices. This is easily done, as the config files, are the actual switch configuration we get from "sh run". That means we can quickly go to an automated approach of managing devices, from a manual one. This requires the creators of the automation to have to learn less about Ansible as well.

==== Tasks
. ‚òëÔ∏è Task: Apply the below desired state (the one we used before) to the leaf1 and leaf2 switches, using the arista.eos.eos_config module and static configuration files.
* Name the playbook config_static.yml
* Use two separate plays in your playbook, where each play targets a separate switch (leaf1 or leaf2).
* If you do not create separate plays or otherwise manage targeting, you will misconfigure your switches.
* You can fetch the running config with a simple "sh run" or fetch it below. PS. You do not need the complete running config. Only the sections you need to accomplish the target state.
* The formatting should follow the vendor standard, when it comes to normal config intendation. For Arista, that is 3 spaces for intendation.

=== 2.7.3 Using the config module to load dynamic config files into devices

Now it's time to review how we can use the powerful templating language jinja to dynamically create configuration, which we load using the config module. Basically, a template allows us to use things variables and features such as loops, to effectively create multiple variants of a network device configuration file out of a single template.

.Example template file:
[source,jinja2]
----
{% for vlan in vlans %}
vlan {{ vlan.vlanid }}
   name {{ vlan.name }}
{% endfor %} 
----


.Translates into:
[source,ini]
----
vlan 15
   name app-blue
vlan 16
   name app-green
----


.WHEN we have a variable file which looks like this:
[source,yaml]
----
---
vlans:
 - vlanid: 15
   name: app-blue
 - vlanid: 16
   name: app-green
----


The benefit of templates is to be able to use variables / facts in the rendering of the finished file which ends up on the managed device. It allows us to set these variables or facts for a specific group of devices, or a specific device, to govern what the device should look like.

If you are not familiar with the template concept in Ansible, you will need to read up on it to affectively use the config template functionality. It's not a prerequisite to pass this lab though. For now, have a brief look through below webpages to get a better idea:

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_templating.html[Introduction to templating @ ansible.com]

* link:https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/[Template designer documentation @ jinja]

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_filters.html[Filters and data transformation @ ansible.com]

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/arista/eos/eos_config_module.html#parameter-src[Arista EOS config template information]

Now that you are an expert at jinja and Ansible templating, let's begin.

==== Tasks:

. ‚òëÔ∏è Task: Create a playbook called config_template.yml and replace the leaf1.cfg and leaf2.cfg files we used previously with a single template.

* Name the template leafs.j2

* Look at the example in this chapter for inspiration (on how to use for loops and lists).

* Use the "template: src" function to upload the configuration to said devices.

* Use variables stored in host_vars/clab-lab2-leaf1/2 files to set device unique information (read: ip address) and use group_vars/all to set common variables for the VLANs.

* Create the config_template.yml playbook as such:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- name: "Apply desired static network configuration to leaf switches"
  hosts: leafs
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Apply device configuration
      arista.eos.eos_config:
        src: leafs.j2
----


* Create the leafs.j2 template as such:
+
[source,jinja2]
----
{% for vlan in vlans %}
vlan {{ vlan.vlanid }}
   name {{ vlan.name }}
{% endfor %} 

{% for intf in interfaces %}
interface {{ intf.name }}
   description {{ intf.description }}
   mtu 9214 
   no switchport
   ip address {{ intf.address }}
{% endfor %}
----


* Create host_vars/clab-lab2-leaf1 as such:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet11
    description: spine1
    address: 10.0.1.1/31
  - name: Ethernet12
    description: spine2
    address: 10.0.2.1/31
----


* Create host_vars/clab-lab2-leaf2 as such:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet11
    description: spine1
    address: 10.0.1.3/31
  - name: Ethernet12
    description: spine2
    address: 10.0.2.3/31
----


* Create group_vars/all as such:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
vlans:
 - vlanid: 39
   name: prod
 - vlanid: 40
   name: test-l2-vxlan

TIP: Well done. If you passed all the exercises, you now have experience with a lot of useful Ansible related technology which you need to know when it comes to network automation.

TIP: If this was easy, you may be ready for a deep dive, in lab-3. Otherwise, you are now done with the workshop.
