= Section 3: Applying best practices to build a BGP EVPN architecture
This is the last and final part of the workshop, in which you will get to apply all your knowledge to create a fully functioning BGP EVPN spine/leaf setup.

IMPORTANT: This is a free form excercise, so if you struggeled a little bit before, this may be an excercise you may want to do later on as you have built more experience.

If you want to read up on BGP EVPN based architectures, you can read David Varnum's excellent writup on the topic, here:

* link:https://overlaid.net/2018/08/27/arista-bgp-evpn-overview-and-concepts/[Arista BGP EVPN Overview and concepts]

And this blog, where David Varnum step-by-step reviews a setup:

== 3.1 Review of containerlab and desired state device configuration
First off, what we want to accomplish, looks like this:

image::overview-evpn-bgp.png[overview,95%]

Leaf switches are organized in pairs of two, which are then connected to our spine switches. Connected to each leaf pair, we have a Linux system which is connected to both leaf switches. This Linux system has the typical Linux network troubleshooting tools re-installed.

For this lab, there are two already prepared containerlab files:
* $LABDIR/containerlab/lab3-start.yml
* $LABDIR/containerlab/lab3-full.yml

* The -start version will setup your starting point for automation, switches with only auth and a management interface setup, like we before in our labs.
* The -full version will setup everything fully configured, allowing you to explore the setup in details.

. ☑️ Task: Destroy the previous environment and setup our starting point by running below commands:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd $LABDIR/containerlab
sudo containerlab --runtime podman destroy -t lab2.yml
sudo containerlab --runtime podman deploy -t lab3-start.yml
../scripts/ansible_hosts.sh lab3
----


. ☑️ Task: Review the desired state configuration of each and every switch by looking at their running configurations:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd $LABDIR/containerlab/configs

ls *full*
leaf1-full.cfg	leaf2-full.cfg	leaf3-full.cfg	leaf4-full.cfg	leaf5-full.cfg	leaf6-full.cfg	leaf7-full.cfg	leaf8-full.cfg	spine1-full.cfg  spine2-full.cfg

more leaf11-full.cfg
more spine1-full.cfg
----

+
That is how your switches should look like when you are done.

== 3.2 Automating your network
Now it's time for you to decide on how you will use Ansible to accomplish a working version of the EVPN BPG architecture. The easiest way to accomplish this will be to use the arista.eos.eos_config module and push the working running configs to each switch. In real life, that is not always the best approach. Consider what parts of this network's configuration which you may be changing more often. Are there parts of the network configuration which you would rather manage separately? 

. ☑️ Task: Decide on how you will setup the network, create your Ansible automation and run it.
* If you end up in a dead end, you can always recreate the network by running the commands you ran to set it up first.
* To tips on validating the setup, see next section 3.3.



. ☑️ Task: Explore different approaches and consider how it would be to maintain this network more long term. As an example, if you push complete device configuration files initially, consider breaking off parts of it into separate plays, playbooks or even roles.  

== 3.3 Validating your setup

. Show remote vteps

* leaf1#sh vxlan vtep
Remote VTEPS for Vxlan1:

IMPORTANT: If you made it all the way here, what else is there to learn? Well, plenty ofcourse. But you are well on your way already to be able to call yourself an Ansible network automation specialist.
